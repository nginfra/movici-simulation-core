# Fiona is shipped with its own version of PROJ. Aequilibrae also uses PROJ through spatialite.
# We need to be sure to use Fiona's version, otherwise Fiona crashes upon import. So if we at some
# point want to use Fiona (eg through DatasetCreator), we need to import Fiona here to be sure
# that its version is used. See also https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/issues/1161

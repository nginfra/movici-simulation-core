Installation
==============


.. _installation_linux:

Linux
---------------

``movici-simulation-core`` can be installed using pip:

.. code-block::

  pip install movici-simulation-core

This installs ``movici-simulation-core`` and its core requirements with which you can get started to
create your own models and setup simulations. Some models that that are included with 
``movici-simulation-core`` require extra requirements that can be installed separately:

First install ``mod_spatialite``, an extension to Sqlite for geospatial queries. This shared 
library is required by one of ``movici-simulation-core``\s dependencies. Install using your 
favorite packages manager. For example, under Debian/Ubuntu:

.. code-block::
  
  sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-mod-spatialite

Then you can install the extra python requirements throug pip:

.. code-block::
  
  pip install movici-simulation-core[models]

The models that require these extra requirements are

* ``area_aggregation``
* ``overlap_status``
* ``traffic_demand_calculation``
* ``traffic_assignment_calculation``

.. _installation_windows:

Windows
-------

.. note::
  August 2022: One the dependencies is ``Fiona``. This package only recently started providing
  binary wheels for Windows as per version ``1.9a2``. This is an alpha release version. While it
  appears to be stable enough, if you run into any problems regarding Fiona, try running in an
  alternative environment, such as :ref:`installation_alternative_anaconda`

On Windows, installation is still done using ``pip install movici-simulation-core``. For the extra
model requirements install ``mod_spatialite`` as following:

* Get latest Windows binaries from `Gaia-SINS <https://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/>`_
* Extract using `7-Zip <https://www.7-zip.org/>`_
* Copy contents to well-known directory such as ``C:\bin\spatialite`` or 
  ``C:\Program Files\Spatialite``
* Add the contents to the ``PATH`` environment variable. For instructions, see 
  `here <https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm>`_
* Log out from your Windows account and log back in to update your environment
* Test if the installation was succesful by opening a command prompt and running: 
  ``sqlite3 :memory: ".load mod_spatialite"``. This commands returns without any output, otherwise
  an error message is shown


Then you can install the extra python requirements throug pip:

.. code-block::
  
  pip install movici-simulation-core[models]

Alternative environments
-------------------------

.. _installation_alternative_anaconda:

Anaconda
^^^^^^^^

While the Movici libraries cannot be installed using conda, many dependencies (such as ``Fiona`` 
and ``spatialite``) can:

.. code-block::

  conda install libspatialite fiona
  pip install movici-simulation-core[models]

Windows Substystem for Linux (WSL)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While Windows is a supported platform, you may have a better experience when running Movici in
a linux environment. The easiest method for running Linux in Windows is by using 
:abbr:`WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)`. Only WSL 2 is supported, this is default WSL version
for Windows 10 and higher. When using WSL, it is recommended to use VSCode as your development
environment. See `Developing in WSL <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl>`_ for 
installation instructions. After installation of WSL, follow the installation instructuctions for
:ref:`Linux<installation_linux>` for how to install Movici. 


MacOS
^^^^^

Currently, MacOS is not a support operating system. You may be able to install and run Movici 
succesfully, but it requires you to compile certain dependencies from source. If you want to 
install Movici under MacOS, please open an issue on 
`Github <https://github.com/nginfra/movici-simulation-core/issues>`_
